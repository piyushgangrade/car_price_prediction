# car_price_prediction
 


Linear regression algorithm was used in this project to predict the selling price of car. In this we, predict the price at which car will sell based on previous prices. The train.csv file provides the previous selling data for different brands and also determines the pofit or loss if we sell the cars of a brand in future. The error rate is reduced to around 15% depending on the data for training the model.
